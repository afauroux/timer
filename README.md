# Timer
A simple timer/chrono page in html/js/css

# How to use 
- Set a time press start
- You can add multiple timer (the time displayed in the tab name is the shortest)
- You can drag and drop any timer to create a new browser tab
- If you double click a timer, additional controls appear. They allow for:
        - setting a timer name that will be displayed in the tab title
        - putting the timer in chronometer mode
        
# Licence 
- do what you want with the app and the music (of my own making)
- enjoy ;-)
